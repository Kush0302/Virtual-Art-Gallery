               Made in the same year in which Picasso
              created his famed Guernica and The Weeping Woman amid the
              tumultuous years of the Spanish civil war, Femme au béret depicts

              technique known as tenebrism, where stark contrasts are used to
              create an atmosphere of darkness and intensity. By using deep
              shadows to envelop his subjects and strategically placing points
