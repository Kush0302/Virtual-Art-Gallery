              The well-known surrealist piece introduced the image of the soft
              melting pocket watch.[3] It epitomizes Dalí's theory of "softness"
              and "hardness", which was central to his thinking at the time. As
              Dawn Adès wrote, "The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of
              the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist meditation on the
              collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order"

              The painting is a tronie, the Dutch 17th-century description of a
              "head" that was not meant to be a portrait. It depicts a European
              girl wearing "exotic dress", an "oriental turban", and what
              appears to be a very large pearl as an earring.[1] The subject of
              the painting is unknown, with it being possible either that she
              was a real model, or that Vermeer created a more generalised and
              mysterious woman, perhaps representing a Sibyl or biblical figure.

              The Last Judgment (Italian: Il Giudizio Universale)[1] is a fresco
              by the Italian Renaissance painter Michelangelo covering the whole
              altar wall of the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City. It is a
              depiction of the Second Coming of Christ and the final and eternal
              judgment by God of all humanity. The dead rise and descend to
              their fates, as judged by Christ who is surrounded by prominent
              saints.

              The subject of Monet’s 1875 painting of his wife Camille Monet and
              a Child in the Artist’s Garden at Argenteuil is immediately
              recognizable. Both figures are clad in blue striped garments and
              are absorbed by an activity: Camille sews, the child gazes down at
              a book. A toy horse stands in the foreground, and a virtual wall
              of green foliage and blooming red and pink flowers rises behind
              them
